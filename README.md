## About the project
- Here are the main reservation page, the course info page, and the charger summary page. Customer information on the reservation page includes vehicle information and any additional charges that are paid and calculated when a customer rents a car. After submitting the information from the reservation page, all the charges are displayed in a tabular form on the Charges Summary page. The charges summary page shows all the charges for car rental customers. Each charge summary table has two buttons, a see recit and a delete button. After clicking on C Receipt button it will dynamically take to a separate page and there is a button called Download Receipt on clicking on which the receipt will be downloaded in PDF format. And if you click on the delete button, the summary of that charge will be deleted.
